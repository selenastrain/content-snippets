Content Snippets allows you to add sections of content to widget areas.

## Description

Content Snippets makes it easier to add sections of content to widget areas. The default text widget is fine but there are times when you need a bit more. With Content Snippets, you get a `snippets` custom post type and Snippets widget. Simply make a new snippet and select it in the Snippets widget dropdown list. Voila!


## Installation
